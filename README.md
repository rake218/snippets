# Embedded Code Snippets

Small, tested, and reusable embedded code snippets and patterns I use across projects.
Focus: firmware/driver patterns, peripheral helpers, small TinyML helpers, and safe coding tips.

## Structure
- `c/` - C helper functions and examples (I/O, ring buffers, fixed-point math)
- `rust/` - small Rust helpers for embedded usage
- `tinyml/` - TinyML model loader patterns and inference stubs
- `tools/` - small scripts for testing and flashing

## How to use
- Each snippet is self-contained and includes a README explaining dependencies and a short example.
- Use the snippet, adapt license header as needed. For production, use the snippet as a reference and integrate tests.
